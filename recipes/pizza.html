    <h2>This pizza uses hummus instead of the usual red sauce—a unique and healthy pizza for those bored with the traditional. Top with your favorite veggies and cheese.</h2>
    <p>Pizza is a dish of Italian origin consisting of a usually round, flat base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often various other ingredients, which is then baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven. A small pizza is sometimes called a pizzetta.
